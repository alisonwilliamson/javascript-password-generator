An application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.


A series of checkboxes are displayed so the user can decide what characters they 
would like included in their password along with how long they would like their password(min 8 and max 128). 

When the uppercase box is checked it only displays passwords with uppercase letters, when the lowercase box is checked it only displays passwords with lowercase etc. When multiple boxes are checked it only displays passwords based on the checked criteria. 

When the generate password button is clicked a random password is generated based on the selected criteria and displayed in the display box. If the generate button is clicked with no criteria selected, it comes up with a message in the display box that the user needs to make at least one selection before a password will be displayed.

Here is the link to the working site.
